// PrepareSession asks the caller's context twice, and the two answers mean
// different things. The check at the top means "you were already gone before we
// wrote anything". The check inside the recent-files error path means "you left
// while we were scanning" — and that one exists to stop a withdrawal being
// reported as a warning on stderr plus a successful prepare, after the identity
// and instruction memories have already been written on the caller's behalf.
//
// Measured before this file existed: deleting the second check entirely left the
// whole suite green. TestPrepareSessionFailsForACancelledCaller cancels before
// the call, so it is answered by the first check and never reaches the second.
// Both producers return a context error, so "PrepareSession returned
// context.Canceled" is exactly the assertion that cannot tell them apart.
//
// What tells them apart is what is in the store when the error arrives. The
// first check returns before loadIdentity; the second returns after it. So this
// test asserts the error AND the identity memory, and that pair names the
// producer.

// gitStandInThatBlocksUntilKilled puts a `git` on PATH that announces itself and
// then blocks. The scan spawns git through exec.CommandContext, so everything
// below the stand-in is real — real PATH lookup, real process, real kill on
// cancel. Announcing rather than sleeping a fixed time is what keeps the test
// off the clock: the caller cancels because the scan has demonstrably started,
// not because an estimate of how long it takes has elapsed.
//
// The script `exec`s the sleep rather than spawning it, so the blocking process
// is the one exec.CommandContext holds and kills. Spawned as a child it would
// outlive the kill still holding git's stdout pipe, and Wait would sit out the
// whole of waitDelayAfterGitExits before returning.
