// The test above covers a store that is already open. This one covers opening
// it, which turned out to be where the contention actually landed: the test
// above spent months failing roughly half its runs at `create schema: database
// is locked`, before it had performed a single read or write.
//
// The statement that fails is not the schema. It is `PRAGMA journal_mode(WAL)`,
// which needs a brief exclusive lock, and it used to ride in on the DSN — so it
// ran as part of opening the connection, and whichever statement opened that
// connection wore the error. Making it wait is the whole fix, and the wait had
// to be ours: SQLite will not run the busy handler for a lock it has to upgrade,
// so busy_timeout is not entered at all here. That is what this test pins.
//
// Holding a write transaction on the fresh file makes the race deterministic
// rather than roughly-half-the-time. Against the DSN version this fails on every
// run, and it fails instantly — the 0s is the finding, because a store that had
// honoured its own 5s busy_timeout would have outlasted a 150ms lock.

// one leaves the setting at its default and says nothing; and a lost
