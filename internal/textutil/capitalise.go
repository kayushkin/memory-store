// TitleFirstRuneOfEachWord returns s with the first rune of every word
// title-cased and every other rune left exactly as it was.
//
// It exists to replace strings.Title, which has been deprecated since Go 1.18
// and which breaks words at the ASCII apostrophe. Under strings.Title
// "don't panic" comes back "Don'T Panic" and "claxon's quest" comes back
// "Claxon'S Quest". Both of those reach quest names built from free text, so
// the defect is user-visible rather than theoretical.
//
// This function is strings.Title with exactly one deliberate difference: an
// ASCII apostrophe between two word characters does not end a word. It must be
// flanked to join, which is what keeps "don't" one word while leaving a leading
// or trailing apostrophe behaving as it always did, so "'lead" stays "'Lead"
// and "dogs'" stays "Dogs'". Everything else is preserved on purpose, because
// these call sites render existing user-facing strings and a wider change would
// be a silent redesign of their output:
//
//   - A hyphen, dot, slash or space still ends a word, so "code-introspection"
//     stays "Code-Introspection".
//   - A digit or an underscore still does not, so "x2go" stays "X2go" and
//     "code_introspection" stays "Code_introspection".
//   - The rest of each word keeps its own case, so "the ELF guard" stays
//     "The ELF Guard".
//   - The first rune is mapped with unicode.ToTitle, not unicode.ToUpper, so a
//     digraph title-cases rather than upper-casing: "ǆdict" stays "ǅdict".
//
// Only the ASCII apostrophe was ever affected. U+2019, the typographic
// apostrophe, is not a separator under strings.Title either, so "it’s" was
// never broken and is not changed here.
//
// golang.org/x/text/cases.Title is the replacement the deprecation notice
// names, and it is deliberately not used: it lower-cases the remainder of each
// word, so "the ELF guard" would become "The Elf Guard", and it would add a
// module dependency to two repos that have none for the sake of a display
// nicety.
//
// One further difference from strings.Title, which is a fix rather than a
// preservation: strings.Title maps every invalid UTF-8 byte to U+FFFD, so it
// silently corrupts input it cannot decode. Invalid bytes are copied through
// here untouched.
