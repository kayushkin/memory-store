"""Score the apostrophe tests in memory-store by injecting the defects they
exist for.

Verdict column, same inverted reading as the inber-party scorer:

    SOLE DETECTOR  only the new tests failed
    REDUNDANT      a pre-existing test also failed; the sibling is NAMED
    UNNOTICED      nothing failed
    VOID           the tree did not build, so no test ran

A REDUNDANT row must name its sibling. An unnamed one is indistinguishable
from the build-failure bug the forty-seventh pass hit, where two rows read
"a sibling covers this" and in fact no test had run at all.

A SOLE DETECTOR row also says whether an ASSERTION fired or only a fixture
REACH GUARD. Without that split this table cannot answer the question card
`44411ad9` asks — it matched `--- FAIL: <TestName>` and never read the message,
so a new test reddened by its own `t.Fatalf("LoadToolRegistry failed: ...")`
scored identically to one reddened by an assertion about apostrophes. The tests
this file scores really do carry such guards, so the ambiguity was live rather
than theoretical.

The split is the forty-second pass's, and it was already written -- in
`inber-party`'s copy of this same scorer, on a branch of the same name, for the
same fix. It was never propagated here. A fix to an instrument propagates no
better than a fix to a product, and worse, because nothing compiles an
instrument.
